    "description": "This summer we said a bittersweet farewell to Italian pescatarian spot Ufficio on Dundas West. The restaurant we know is no more, but the same owners have transitioned to a new concept in the same space. Gia, meaning ‘God is gracious,’ sees the same delicious Italian fare, served in a more responsible manner. The plant-forward menu of fresh, handmade pasta is rooted in environmental sustainability, with produce coming from local suppliers like 100km Foods and Clearwater Farms.",

Bask in the beauty of their lush, flower-laden heated rooftop patio, with spectacular views of the CN Tower and the city skyline. The club beats are bumping and the twinkle lights are glowing, while you sip on Instagram-worthy cocktails like the Skyflower and snack on share plates like lamb spiducci and fried popcorn chicken.",
