    "description": "The jewel in the landscape of the West Don Lands, Corktown Common is a 7.3 hectare (18 acre) park located at the foot of Lower River Street and Bayview Avenue. Situated on former industrial lands, the park has transformed an underutilized brownfield into a spectacular park and community meeting place featuring a marsh, sprawling lawns, urban prairies, playground areas, a splash pad and a variety of inviting features like a fireplace, permanent barbeque, large communal picnic tables and washrooms. Built as part of the revitalization of the West Don Lands by Waterfront Toronto, this sophisticated park was designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates. The park offers a diverse range of habitats for a growing population of birds, amphibians and insects. Sustainable maintenance practices contribute to the preservation of capital investments made in the new waterfront public park system, and help to protect the ecological integrity of this complex greenspace. The City's dedicated and qualified staff work in this park to provide specialized organic landscape and turf maintenance.",
